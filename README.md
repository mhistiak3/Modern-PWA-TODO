# Modern PWA ToDo App
A modern Progressive Web App (PWA) ToDo application combines the benefits of a native mobile app with the accessibility of a web application. It leverages modern web technologies to offer users a seamless and responsive experience across different devices and platforms. Key features typically include:

1. **Offline Functionality**: Utilizes service workers and caching strategies to ensure the app works offline or in low-connectivity environments, allowing users to access and update their ToDo lists regardless of internet availability.

2. **Responsive Design**: Adapts fluidly to various screen sizes, offering a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

3. **Modern UI/UX**: Incorporates intuitive navigation, animations, and gestures to enhance usability and provide a delightful user experience.
